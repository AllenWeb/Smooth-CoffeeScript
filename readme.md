**Smooth CoffeeScript** is a free book about CoffeeScript and programming. Over 200 pages to guide you and 35 exercises to solve. Go from scratch through functional programming in Underscore over object orientation to a client and server web application with HTML5 Canvas and WebSockets. Download includes book and full source code with and without solutions.

No previous programming knowledge is required. If you already know a scripting language then scan through the Language part and dive into the Paradigm chapters. The samples require a functioning installation of CoffeeScript; see page 9 in the book.
