Download includes book and full source code with and without solutions. The samples require a functioning installation of CoffeeScript; see page 9 in the book. Tested on Mac OS X 10.6.7 and on Windows 7.

Web browser implementations of web sockets currently change regularly. You can contact me on twitter @autotelicum if you have a short question or encounter a problem that might not be worth reporting as an issue.

Windows: The native and prebuilt node.js (0.5.x unstable) mostly works with the source code for the book. Installing the prebuilt cygwin node.js (0.4.x stable) is described by [semperos](http://techylinguist.com/) in [CoffeeScript on Windows 7](http://techylinguist.com/posts/coffeescript-windows-7). Until a stable 0.6 is released, you can try the _Full-Featured Method_ to run all the examples as described in **Smooth CoffeeScript**.
