Windows: The new native and prebuilt node.js v0.5.1 throws an exception when loading CoffeeScript on both WinXP and Win7 in my testing. Installing the prebuilt cygwin node.js 0.4.9 is described by [semperos](http://techylinguist.com/) in [CoffeeScript on Windows 7](http://techylinguist.com/posts/coffeescript-windows-7). Try the _Full-Featured Method_ to run the examples as described in **Smooth CoffeeScript**.
